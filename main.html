	<h1>Paris, France</h1>
	<br>
	<p>France, officially the French Republic, is a country located primarily in Western Europe. It also includes overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world.</p>

		<li><strong>Cassoulet </strong>One particular dish that gained popularity in southern France is Cassoulet. This dish is French comfort food at its best. This peasant dish consists of white beans that are stewed slowly with meat.</li>
		<li><strong>Oeufs en meurette </strong>If you ever find yourself in Burgundy mid-morning then stop off for brunch and try this French version of poached eggs.</li>
		<li><strong>Baguette au fromage </strong>Bread and cheese are staples in a French diet and after you’ve tasted authentic, French bread and French cheese you’ll wonder why they don’t just eat it all the time.</li>
		<li><strong>Bouillabaisse </strong>This traditional Provençal stew originally came from the port of Marseille but now you’ll find it almost anywhere on the South coast of France and, like Cassoulet, every chef tweaks the recipe.</li>
		<li><strong>Religieuse au chocolat </strong>The first thing you should do if you’re ever in Paris is buy one of these from an authentic patisserie or boulangerie.</li>
