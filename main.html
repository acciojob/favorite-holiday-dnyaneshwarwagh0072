	<h1>FRANCE</h1>
	<br>
	<p>France, officially the French Republic, is a country located primarily in Western Europe. It also includes overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Paris </strong>As the world's best place to visit, it's no surprise that the electrifying City of Light tops this list</li>
		<li>If your ideal French vacation involves a little more nature and a little less city, head to the<strong> French Alps</strong></li>
		<li>Glamorous <strong>Nice </strong>occupies a picturesque spot along the French Riviera</li>
		<li><strong>Strasbourg</strong> is the capital of the Alsace region offers the perfect mix of French and German cultures thanks to its position on the France-Germany border</li>
		<li>Quaint, charming<strong> Aix-en-Provence</strong> is a university city known for its tree-lined boulevards, cute cafes and lively markets</li>
	</ol>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Baguettes, Croissants, and Pain au Chocolat</strong> are to France what Hamburgers and Pizzas are to the USA — talk about clichés associated with the regions.</li>
